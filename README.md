This repository demonstrates a common, yet easily overlooked error in Lua: the failure to handle `nil` values. The `bug.lua` file shows the error, while `bugSolution.lua` presents a corrected version.  The issue arises from attempting to perform an arithmetic operation on a `nil` value, which leads to a runtime error. The solution involves adding a check for `nil` before performing the operation.
